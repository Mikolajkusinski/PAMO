    <string name="pancake_recipe">STEP 1 \n
        Put 100g plain flour, 2 large eggs, 300ml milk, 1 tbsp sunflower or vegetable oil and a pinch of salt into a bowl or large jug, then whisk to a smooth batter. This should be similar in consistency to single cream.\n
        STEP 2\n
        Set aside for 30 mins to rest if you have time, or start cooking straight away.\n
        STEP 3\n
        Set a medium frying pan or crÃªpe pan over a medium heat and carefully wipe it with some oiled kitchen paper.\n
        STEP 4\n
        When hot, cook your pancakes for 1 min on each side until golden, using around half a ladleful of batter per pancake. Keep them warm in a low oven as you make the rest.\n
        STEP 5\n
        Serve with lemon wedges and caster sugar, or your favourite filling. Once cold, you can layer the pancakes between baking parchment, then wrap in cling film and freeze for up to two months.

        1.Boil Water or Milk: In a saucepan, bring the water (or milk) to a boil over medium-high heat. If you\'re using milk, be careful not to let it scorch; stir occasionally.\n\n
        2.Add Oats and Salt: Once the liquid is boiling, stir in the rolled oats and a pinch of salt. Reduce the heat to medium-low.\n\n
        3.Cook the Oats: Let the oats simmer gently, stirring occasionally, for about 5-7 minutes. If you prefer a thicker consistency, cook for a few minutes longer. For a creamier texture, you can add more liquid.\n\n
        4.Sweeten: Once the oats have reached your desired consistency, remove the saucepan from the heat. Sweeten the oatmeal to taste with your preferred sweetener, stirring well to incorporate.\n\n
        5.Serve: Transfer the oatmeal to serving bowls. Top with your favorite toppings, such as sliced fruits, nuts, seeds, or a sprinkle of cinnamon.\n\n
